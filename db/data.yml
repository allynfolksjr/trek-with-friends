    - 'Stardate 1533.6: The Enterprise makes a rendezvous with the S.S. Antares and
      picks up a 17 year old boy, Charlie Evans who is the only survivor of a colony
      expedition that crashed on the planet Thasus. Captain Ramart and his staff rave
      about the boy, but Kirk can''t help but be puzzled when Ramart refuses luxury
      items and hurries back to the Antares. Charlie, without social skills of any
      measure, seems a bit strange and unrefined but states that he grew up alone
      with only the record tapes from the wreckage for company. Sometime later, Captain
      Ramart signals the Enterprise and tries to warn Kirk about something, but just
      then the Antares is destroyed. Kirk doesn''t think much about Charlie''s disinterested
      reaction to the deaths of his former friends, but Spock begins to suspect that
      there is more to the boy than they know. This is confirmed when Charlie makes
      a crewman disappear for laughing at him while in the gym. During this time,
      Charlie becomes infatuated with the first ^girl^ he saw after coming aboard
      the Enterprise, Yeoman Rand. Unable to control his desires, Charlie pesters
      Rand until she is forced to hurt him, first by rejecting the boy and then by
      slapping him while in her quarters. This, of course, causes Charlie to make
      her disappear as well. Now realizing the full extent of Charlie''s powers and
      the danger he could pose to civilization, Kirk tries to alter the ship''s course
      away from their next stop, Colony 5, but Charlie learns of his plans, seizes
      control of the Enterprise, and locks in a course for Colony 5. By this time
      the Thasians, noncorporeal beings who really raised Charlie and gave him his
      powers, discover that the boy is missing and intercept the Enterprise. Despite
      Charlie''s pleas not to be taken away, the Thasians remove Charlie from the
      Enterprise and restore the crew back to normal.'

Adding to their difficulty is the presence of the Klingons, whose sole desire is obtaining what they need through guile and/or violence.

      "The Deadly Years" is a second-season episode of the original science fiction television series Star Trek, first broadcast December 8, 1967 and repeated on August 16, 1968. It is episode #41, production #40, written by David P. Harmon, and directed by Joseph Pevney.

      This episode explores the question of whether advancing age is a relevant reason to remove someone from a position of authority. It is shown that, while one's physical abilities may be hindered by aging, the mental faculties are often as sharp as they ever were; indeed, the experience of age oftentimes more than makes up for mental acuity.

      In this episode, strange radiation exposes the command crew of the Enterprise to the effects of rapid aging.

      In this episode, Captain James T. Kirk becomes obsessed with destroying a deadly entity he once encountered in his youth.

While Captain Kirk is the primary focus, the viewer sees glimpses of these emotions in other members of the ship. It is interesting to note that, at various times, the "fight or flight" instinct is shown as an internal battle which one has to overcome in order to find emotional peace.

      "The Trouble With Tribbles" is the 44th episode of the American science fiction television series Star Trek, the 15th episode of the second season. It was first broadcast in the United States on December 29, 1967, on NBC. The episode was the first professional work of writer David Gerrold, and went through a variety of drafts before it reached the screen. Due to an error in the size of typeface, an approved version needed to be reduced by twenty pages prior to filming. Nichelle Nichols remarked that she had "never seen a script go through so many changes—and stay so much the same". "The Trouble With Tribbles" was one of several episodes directed by Joseph Pevney, who was one of the most prolific directors of the series.

      In this episode, the ship travels to Deep Space Station K7 to guard a consignment of grain bound for Sherman's Planet. On arrival, a trader named Cyrano Jones gives Lt. Uhura a tribble, with dramatic consequences. Kirk and the crew also have to deal with the arrival of Captain Koloth and his Klingon battlecruiser, but the tribbles unexpectedly reveal a plot to poison the grain.

      Around 1,500 tribbles were created for the episode, with special tribbles created for certain purposes with beanbags or surgical balloons inserted in them. Three additional sets were created for the episode, although there was problems with finding enough matching chairs for the trading post area. The chairs had to be pulled out of showrooms around Los Angeles County, and Pevney was warned to make sure they weren't damaged during the episode's brawl scene. William Campbell had previously appeared as Trelane in "The Squire of Gothos" and was intended to be a recurring villain as Koloth. Due to his other work commitments, this was cut from the show but he did return in the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode as Koloth in "Blood Oath". William Schallert appeared as Nilz Baris, and later appeared as a Bajoran in the DS9 episode "Sanctuary".

      "Terra Prime" is the 21st episode of the fourth season of the American science fiction television series Star Trek: Enterprise, and originally aired on May 13, 2005. The story was developed by Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens, along with André Bormanis, and developed into a script by the Reeves-Stevenses and show runner Manny Coto. The episode is the second of a two-part story, which started in "Demons". The episode was directed by Marvin Rush, his second for the series.

      Set in the 22nd century, the series follows the adventures of the first Starfleet starship Enterprise, registration NX-01. In this episode, John Frederick Paxton, the leader of the human xenophobic group Terra Prime, threatens to use an array on Mars designed to redirect comets to destroy Starfleet Command, unless all aliens leave Earth immediately. Enterprise Captain Jonathan Archer and an away team take a shuttlepod to the array to stop Paxton and attempt to shut down the array.

      The guest actors who appeared in "Demons" were joined by Derek Magyar and Eric Pierpoint, who appeared earlier in the season in "Affliction", while Joel Swetow had previously appeared in episodes of Deep Space Nine and The Next Generation. The script called for a reference to the United States space program and so the Carl Sagan Memorial Station and the Mars Exploration Rover Sojourner were included in a shot added in post production. "Terra Prime" received a Nielsen rating of 2.0/4% and it was praised by critics who described it as a "real" episode and there were suggestions that had Enterprise gone into a further season then the story could have acted as an ongoing subplot. It was ranked as the best episode of the series by Empire magazine.

      Star Trek is an American science fiction television series created by Gene Roddenberry that follows the adventures of the starship USS Enterprise and its crew.

      The show is set in the Milky Way galaxy, roughly during the 2260s. The crew is headed by Captain James T. Kirk, first officer Spock, and chief medical officer Leonard McCoy. Shatner's voice-over introduction during each episode's opening credits stated the starship's purpose:

      The series was produced from 1966-67 by Desilu Productions, and by Paramount Television from 1968-69. Star Trek aired on NBC from September 8, 1966 to June 3, 1969. Although this television series had the title of Star Trek, it later acquired the retronym of Star Trek: The Original Series to distinguish the show within the media franchise that it began. Star Trek's Nielsen ratings while on NBC were low, and the network canceled it after three seasons and 79 episodes. Nevertheless, the show had a major influence on popular culture and it became a cult classic in broadcast syndication during the 1970s. The show eventually spawned a franchise, consisting of five additional television series, 12 theatrical films, and numerous books, games, toys, and other products.

      Star Trek: Deep Space Nine is a science fiction television series set in the Star Trek universe.

      The show is set in the Milky Way galaxy, in the years 2369 - 2375. Unlike the other Star Trek TV shows, it takes place on a space station instead of a starship, so as not to have two series with starships at the same time. This made continuing story arcs and the appearance of recurring characters much more feasible. The show is noted for its well-developed characters and its original, complex plots. The series depended on darker themes, less physical exploration of space, and an emphasis on many aspects of war.

      DS9 premiered in 1993 and ran for seven seasons, ending in 1999. Rooted in Gene Roddenberry’s Star Trek universe, it was the first Trek spin-off created without direct involvement from Roddenberry, although he did give his blessing to the concept shortly before his death in 1991. The series was created by Rick Berman and Michael Piller, at the request of Brandon Tartikoff, and produced by Paramount Television. Key writers, in addition to Berman and Piller, included showrunner Ira Steven Behr, Robert Hewitt Wolfe, Ronald D. Moore, Peter Allan Fields, Bradley Thompson, David Weddle, Hans Beimler, and René Echevarria.

      Star Trek: Voyager is a science fiction television series set in the Star Trek universe.

      The show is initially set on the other side of the Milky Way galaxy, 75,000 light-years from Earth, during the 2370s; the setting migrates across that distance over the course of the show's run. It follows the adventures of the Starfleet vessel USS Voyager, which became stranded in the Delta Quadrant while pursuing a renegade Maquis ship. Both ships' crews merge aboard Voyager to make the estimated 75-year journey home.

      The show was created by Rick Berman, Michael Piller, and Jeri Taylor and is the fifth incarnation of Star Trek, which began with the 1960s series Star Trek, created by Gene Roddenberry. It was produced for seven seasons, from 1995 to 2001, and is the only Star Trek TV series with a female captain, Kathryn Janeway, as a main character.

      Star Trek: Voyager aired on UPN and was the network's second longest-running series.

      Star Trek: Enterprise is a science fiction TV series and a prequel to the original Star Trek set 100 years before. The series premiered September 26, 2001 on the UPN television network with the final episode airing on May 13, 2005.

      The series takes place in the 22nd century aboard Earth's first warp 5 capable starship Enterprise NX-01 designed for long-range exploration of the galaxy and captained by Jonathan Archer. The NX designation indicates that this Enterprise is an experimental prototype.
